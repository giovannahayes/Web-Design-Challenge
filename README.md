# Web-Design-Challenge

#### This repository seeks to create a website using HTML and CSS primarily from Bootstrap code snippets. A prior data analysis WeatherPy will be used as the data to create a website "Dashboard" to demonstrate the power of being able share and communicate your data science results publicly on a website. The website will be deployed on GitHub pages as the host of the .html files.

## Latitude Analysis Dashboard

#### Individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

#### The live deployed website can be found here: [Web Visualization](https://giovannahayes.github.io/Web-Design-Challenge/index.html)

## Website Pages
#### For reference, see the "Screenshots" section below.
#### The website consists of 7 pages total:
#### A landing page containing:
* An explanation of the project.
* Links to each visualizations page.
#### Four visualization pages, each with:
* A descriptive title and heading tag.
* The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
* A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
#### A "Comparisons" page that:
* Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
*Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
#### A "Data" page that:
* Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

#### The website has at the top of every page a navigation menu that:
* Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
* Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
* Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, and "Data" which links to the data page.
* Is responsive (using media queries). The nav must have similar behavior as the screenshots "Navigation Menu" section (notice the background color change).
